To compile bin/tap.exe, all you have to do is type

$ script/build.sh <config> 

with <config>=ifort, corresponding to a template file in
config/<config>.mkmf.template.

This automatic system performs the following steps:

1. creates a makefile (build/Makefile) based on all source in src using script/config.sh,
2. builds the executable using script/build.sh
3. installs the executable to bin/tap.exe
