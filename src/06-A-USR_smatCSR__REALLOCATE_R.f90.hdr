!#DETAILS
!  Note that this routine assumes the start of row pointers to be
!  in increasing order.  This should be a matter of concern only
!  if this routine is called at an intermediate state in the
!  construction of a matrix where the matrix data structure is not
!  well defined as defined in is_ok (S).  If you use only routines from
!  this library to construct the matrix, it should pose no problem.
